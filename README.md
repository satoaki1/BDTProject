# Data science with python and its libraries
This project is assessed during the Big Data Technology module in Taylor's University in Malaysia. With using python, we have prepared a dirty, raw unstructured data which is not cleaned yet, cleaned the data and customized to the structured data and created a prediction model due to the structured data.

Below are the Python libraries we have applied for this project:

* **Pandas**
* **Kesla**
* **NumPy**
* **Tensorflow**

The raw data file in .csv format contains information about house prices and other relevant details. The file is named `Kuala_Lumpur_house_prices.csv` and includes data for 50 houses. However, some data elements are missing in a few instances. To improve the data quality, a new .csv file named `Kuala_Lumpur_house_prices_clear.csv` will be created, which will contain only the clean and categorized data. The process of data cleaning and categorization will be carried out using the Python programming language, and the code will be written in the file `clean-data.py`.

Data file in `clean-data.py` would be modified by the program in `predict.py` to create a prediction model.
